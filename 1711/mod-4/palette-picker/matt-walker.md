# Palette Picker Submission Form

[Project Spec](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/palette-picker.html)

# Basics

#### Link to the GitHub Repository for the Project
[palette-picker](https://github.com/mttwlkr/palette-picker)

#### Link to the Deployed Application
[heroku](https://palette-picker-mttwlkr.herokuapp.com/)

#### Link to your annotated server file
[annotated server file](https://github.com/mttwlkr/palette-picker/edit/master/server.js)

## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I think so

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None. I barely got this done. I would've DRY'ed up my code before doing extensions.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/mttwlkr/palette-picker/blob/f55a3f681874f7fe81ba59a8f5f3485105383029/public/js/scripts.js#L160)

* Why were you proud of this piece of code?

Because for a lot of this project, I felt rushed and just wanted to get through it, so I wrote some repetitive, poorly-planned code. This was one of the DRY-er pieces of code I wrote.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/mttwlkr/palette-picker/blob/f55a3f681874f7fe81ba59a8f5f3485105383029/public/js/scripts.js#L41)

* Why do you feel not awesome about the code? What challenges did you face trying to write/refactor it?

Like I said, I felt rushed and just wanted to get through it, so I wrote some repetitive, poorly-planned code. This being a prime example. I repeat most of this function starting again on line 212, but I ran out of time, was rushing and just needed it to work.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

[test suite](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30199861/39655985-180bda18-4fba-11e8-9610-677a0f7c78e7.png)

#### Link to Design Inspiration

* Show us what you used as design inspiration (another color picker site, a dribbble UI element, a user flow, etc.) and explain what you stole from it

https://codepen.io/Volorf/full/GqzzRJ

I wanted to steal the subtle changing of the background color based on hover. After a good while, I realized that I couldn’t change parent elements based on hovering a non-direct child element with pseudo selectors, or at least I couldn’t figure it out. Instead of doing it in javascript, I figured I should get more functionality before going down that road. So, I stole the thick border on click (they have it on hover) for my lock screen.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Anything else you wanna say!

Remembering jQuery was hard hahah.
