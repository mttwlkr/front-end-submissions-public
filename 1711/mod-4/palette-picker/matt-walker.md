## Completion

#### Were you able to complete the base functionality?

I believe so

#### Which extensions, if any, did you complete?

None. I barely got this done. I would've DRY'ed up my code before doing extensions.

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/mttwlkr/palette-picker/blob/f55a3f681874f7fe81ba59a8f5f3485105383029/public/js/scripts.js#L160)

Because for a lot of this project, I felt rushed and just wanted to get through it, so I wrote some repetitive, poorly-planned code. This was one of the DRY-er pieces of code I wrote.

#### Link to a specific block of your code on GitHub that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/mttwlkr/palette-picker/blob/f55a3f681874f7fe81ba59a8f5f3485105383029/public/js/scripts.js#L41)

Like I said, I felt rushed and just wanted to get through it, so I wrote some repetitive, poorly-planned code. This being a prime example. I repeat most of this function starting again on line 212, but I ran out of time, was rushing and just needed it to work.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

I wanted to steal the subtle changing of the background color based on hover. After a good while, I realized that I couldn’t change parent elements based on hovering a non-direct child element with pseudo selectors, or at least I couldn’t figure it out. Instead of doing it in javascript, I figured I should get more functionality before going down that road. So, I stole the thick border on click (they have it on hover) for my lock screen.

#### Please feel free to ask any other questions or make any other statements below!

Remembering jQuery was hard hahah.
